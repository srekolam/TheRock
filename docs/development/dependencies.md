# Dependencies

TheRock manages two categories of third-party dependencies, distinguished by
their packaging behavior (see [`BUILD_TOPOLOGY.toml`](/BUILD_TOPOLOGY.toml) for
the build topology):

1. **Sysdeps** ([`third-party/sysdeps/`](/third-party/sysdeps/)) — libraries (zlib,
   elfutils, libdrm, numactl, etc.) built from source with SONAME rewriting and
   symbol versioning so that ROCm can ship private copies without conflicting with
   system-installed versions. This is the mechanism that enables portable
   distribution.
1. **Other third-party libraries** ([`third-party/`](/third-party/)) — libraries
   used as build dependencies that are not exposed externally and/or are not
   typically available as system packages (fmt, spdlog, flatbuffers,
   googletest, etc.). These are not given special packaging treatment. Most are
   `CORE` dependencies required by some subproject unconditionally while the
   `HOST_MATH` libraries (host-blas, SuiteSparse, fftw3) are optional.

The rest of this document covers the sysdeps in detail.

## Sysdeps

The ROCm projects have a number of dependencies. Typically those that escape
any specific library and are generally available as part of an OS distribution
are the concern of TheRock. In these cases, TheRock prefers to build them
all from source in such that:

- They are installed into the `lib/rocm_sysdeps` prefix.
- All ROCm libraries can find them by adding an appropriate relative RPATH.
- For symbol-versioned libraries, all symbols will be prefixed with
  `AMDROCM_SYSDEPS_1.0_`; whereas for non-versioned libraries, they will be
  built to version all symbols with `AMDROCM_SYSDEPS_1.0`.
- SONAMEs and semantic version symlink redirects are altered so that a single
  SONAME shared library with a prefix of `rocm_sysdeps_` is available to
  link against, using a `lib{originalname}.so` as a dev symlink.
- Any PackageConfig descriptors are altered to be location independent.
- PackageConfig and CMake `find_package` config files are advertised (being
  created as necessary) so that package resolution happens the same as if
  they were OS installed.

In order for this setup to work, a number of conventions need to be followed
project wide:

- Sub-projects should declare their use of a sysdep by including one or more of
  the global variables in their `RUNTIME_DEPS` (these will be empty if
  bundling is not enabled or supported for the target OS):
  - `THEROCK_BUNDLED_BZIP2`
  - `THEROCK_BUNDLED_ELFUTILS`
  - `THEROCK_BUNDLED_HWLOC`
  - `THEROCK_BUNDLED_LIBCAP`
  - `THEROCK_BUNDLED_LIBDRM`
  - `THEROCK_BUNDLED_LIBLZMA`
  - `THEROCK_BUNDLED_NUMACTL`
  - `THEROCK_BUNDLED_SQLITE3`
  - `THEROCK_BUNDLED_ZLIB`
  - `THEROCK_BUNDLED_ZSTD`
- Sub-projects must arrange for any libraries that depend on these to add the
  RPATH `lib/rocm_sysdeps/lib`.
- All projects should use the same package resolution technique (see below).

## Canonical Way to Depend

Per usual with CMake and the proliferation of operating systems, there is no
one true way to depend on a library. In general, if common distributions make
a library available via `find_package(foo CONFIG)`, we prefer that mechanism
be used consistently.

Implementation notes for each library is below:

## BZip2

- Canonical method: `find_package(BZip2)`
- Import library: `BZip2::BZip2`
- Alternatives: None (some OS vendors will provide alternatives but the source
  distribution of bzip2 has no opinion)

## Expat

- Canonical method: `find_package(expat)`
- Import library: `expat::expat`

## GMP

- Canonical method: `find_package(gmp)`
- Import library: `gmp::gmp`

## hwloc

- Canonical method: `find_package(hwloc CONFIG)`
- Import library: `hwloc::hwloc`

## ELFUTILS

Supported sub-libraries: `libelf`, `libdw`.

### libelf

- Canonical method: `find_package(LibElf)`
- Import library: `elf::elf`
- Alternatives: `pkg_check_modules(ELF libelf)`

### libdw

- Canonical method: `find_package(libdw)`
- Import library: `libdw::libdw`
- Alternatives: `pkg_check_modules(DW libdw)`

## libcap

Provides Linux capabilities for privileged operations (used by RDC).

- Canonical method: `find_package(Libcap)`
- Import library: `Libcap::Libcap`
- Alternatives: `pkg_check_modules(LIBCAP libcap)` or direct linking (used by RDC)

## libdrm

Supported sub-libraries: `libdrm`, `libdrm_amdgpu`

### libdrm

- Canonical method: `pkg_check_modules(DRM REQUIRED IMPORTED_TARGET libdrm)`
- Import library: `PkgConfig::DRM`
- Vars: `DRM_INCLUDE_DIRS`

### libdrm_amdgpu

- Canonical method: `pkg_check_modules(DRM_AMDGPU REQUIRED IMPORTED_TARGET libdrm_amdgpu)`
- Import library: `PkgConfig::DRM_AMDGPU`
- Vars: `DRM_AMDGPU_INCLUDE_DIRS`

## liblzma

- Canonical method: `find_package(LibLZMA)`
- Import library: `LibLZMA::LibLZMA`
- Alternatives: `pkg_check_modules(LZMA liblzma)`

## MPFR

- Canonical method: `find_package(mpfr)`
- Import library: `mpfr::mpfr`

## NCurses

- Canonical method: `find_package(ncurses)`
- Import library: `ncurses::ncurses`

### numactl

Provides the `libnuma` library. Tools are not included in bundled sysdeps.

- Canonical method: `find_package(NUMA)`
- Import library: `numa::numa`
- Vars: `NUMA_INCLUDE_DIRS`, `NUMA_INCLUDE_LIBRARIES` (can be used to avoid
  a hard-coded dep on `numa::numa`, which seems to vary across systems)
- Alternatives: `pkg_check_modules(NUMA numa)`

## simde

SIMDe (SIMD Everywhere) is a header-only portability library for SIMD intrinsics.

- Canonical method: `pkg_check_modules(simde REQUIRED IMPORTED_TARGET simde)`
- Import library: `PkgConfig::simde`
- Vars: `simde_INCLUDE_DIRS`
- Alternatives: none
- Note: Header-only library, provides portable SIMD intrinsics (SSE, AVX, NEON, etc.)

## sqlite3

- Canonical method: `find_package(SQLite3)`
- Import library: `SQLite::SQLite3`
- Alternatives: none

## zlib

- Canonical method: `find_package(ZLIB)`
- Import library: `ZLIB::ZLIB`
- Alternatives: `pkg_check_modules(ZLIB zlib)`

## zstd

- Canonical method: `find_package(zstd)`
- Import library: `zstd::libzstd` (preferred - INTERFACE target that wraps the concrete library)
- Alternatives:
  - `zstd::libzstd_shared` - explicit shared library target
  - `pkg_check_modules(ZSTD libzstd)`
- Note: Upstream zstd's CMake install generates both `zstd::libzstd` (INTERFACE) and
  `zstd::libzstd_shared` (SHARED IMPORTED). The INTERFACE target forwards to the
  appropriate concrete target, abstracting static vs shared selection. Prefer
  `zstd::libzstd` for new code.
