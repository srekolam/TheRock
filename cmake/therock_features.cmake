# therock_features.cmake
# Registry of features that can be enabled/disabled when building TheRock.
# In this context, "feature" can refer to either a top-level component/project
# or some optional configuration of it (typically as "project_feature").
# Features can have dependencies, which are a superset of the project
# dependencies and must be kept rationalized by hand.
#
# Each feature results in the following changes to the caller scope:
#   THEROCK_ENABLE_${feature_name}: boolean of whether enabled/disabled
#   THEROCK_REQUIRES_${feature_name}: List of features that are required to
#     be enabled for this feature
#   THEROCK_PLATFORM_DISABLED_${feature_name}: List of platforms where this
#     feature is disabled (only set if DISABLE_PLATFORMS is specified)
#   THEROCK_ALL_FEATURES: Added to this global list of features.
#
# A feature is enabled by default unless if the GROUP keyword is specified.
# In this case, it's default state is dependent on THEROCK_ENABLE_${group}.
