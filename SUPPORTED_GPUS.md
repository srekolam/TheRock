# ROCm Support on GPUs and APUs

> ⚠️ **Note:** This document covers the development-status of GPU support. To download official development builds for various configurations, please see the release page: [RELEASES.md](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/blob/main/RELEASES.md).

TheRock represents the development branch of ROCm and this page documents the progress that each AMD GPU architecture is making towards being supported in a future released version of ROCm. The official [compatibility matrix](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/compatibility/compatibility-matrix.html) should be consulted for AMD GPU support in released ROCm software, whereas the content on this page serves as a leading indicator for what will be referenced there. Please check back as development progresses to support each GPU architecture.

Note that some fully supported GPU architectures may show a more limited state of readiness on this page because they have been qualified through a different, pre-existing release mechanism and are still in the process of being fully onboarded to TheRock.

> [!NOTE]
> For the purposes of the table below:
>
> - *Sanity-Tested* means "either in CI or some light form of manual QA has been performed".
> - *Release-Ready* means "it is supported and tested as part of our overall release process".
